# OpenAI Function Calling Demo

## Overview
This project is a full-stack, production-ready demo designed to inspire and empower developers to build advanced AI-powered applications using OpenAI's APIs. It showcases best practices for integrating reasoning models, multimodal capabilities, and agent tools in a modern developer workflow.

## Why This Project?
- **Inspirational Demo:** Orchestrates function calling with LLMs, integrating real-world APIs (weather, calendar, translation) and handling structured outputs.
- **Developer Experience:** Features robust error handling, logging, modular code, and reliability patterns to accelerate developer productivity and adoption.
- **Technical Content:** Includes clear code samples, modular architecture, and documentation to educate and inspire the developer community.
- **Extensibility:** Built for easy extension—add new tools, APIs, or agent capabilities with minimal friction. Example functions are provided and new ones can be added in minutes.
- **Responsible AI:** Follows best practices for secure key management, safe API usage, and transparent error reporting.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Full-stack engineering (FastAPI backend, React frontend)
- API integration and orchestration
- LLM function calling and structured output handling
- Logging, monitoring, and error management
- Developer tooling and productivity scripts (setup, testing, environment management)
- Technical documentation and code samples
- Community engagement and feedback-driven improvement

## Project Structure
- `backend/` — FastAPI app, OpenAI integration, modular functions (weather, calendar, translation), logging, and utility scripts
- `frontend/` — React app with a modern UI for interacting with the backend and visualizing results

## Getting Started
See the `backend/` and `frontend/` folders for setup instructions. Example productivity scripts and environment setup are included.

This project is designed to:
- Inspire developers with practical, production-ready AI demos and sample apps
- Educate through clear, high-quality technical content, tutorials, and code samples
- Accelerate adoption of OpenAI APIs and best practices
- Foster a vibrant developer ecosystem by making it easy to extend, remix, and build upon
- Demonstrate best practices for developer enablement, error handling, and responsible AI

## Next Steps & Extensions
- Add more sample tools and agent integrations (e.g., multimodal, Codex, custom agents)
- Write tutorials and blog posts based on this repo
- Engage with the developer community for feedback and improvement
- Showcase at developer events and online platforms
