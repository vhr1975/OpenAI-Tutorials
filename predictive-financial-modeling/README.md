# Predictive Financial Modeling + LLM Scenario Narratives

# Telco Customer Churn Data Science Showcase

This project demonstrates how to predict customer churn and estimate financial impact using classical machine learning and LLM-powered insights, tailored for strategic finance decision support (OpenAI-style).

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict customer churn, estimate revenue at risk, and demonstrate how data science supports strategic finance decisions.
- **Classical ML:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost for churn prediction and feature importance.
- **Explainability:** SHAP for model interpretation and actionable insights.
- **LLM Layer:** Use OpenAI GPT to generate executive memos, scenario narratives, and business recommendations from model outputs.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Simulate retention uplift and financial impact of interventions (e.g., contract changes, discounts).

## Dataset
- Main: Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)
- Location: `data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and exploratory analysis (EDA)
2. Feature engineering (tenure buckets, one-hot encoding, scaling)
3. Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model evaluation (AUC, classification report)
5. Explainability (SHAP summary plots)
6. Scenario simulation & causal inference (DoWhy, EconML stubs)
7. LLM-powered memo generation (OpenAI GPT stub)
8. Dashboarding & storytelling (Streamlit/Plotly Dash stub)
9. Automation & reproducibility (code packaging, retraining, reporting)
